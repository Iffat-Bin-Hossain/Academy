## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Production Ready)

#### Using the Docker Script
```bash
# Production deployment
./run-docker.sh start

# View logs
./run-docker.sh logs

# Stop services
./run-docker.sh stop
```

#### Manual Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

#### Docker Services

### Legacy Issues (Non-Docker)

**Backend won't start:**
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version  # Should be 17+

# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean build bootRun
```

**Frontend won't start:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

**CORS errors:**
- Backend CORS is configured for localhost:3000
- Check SecurityConfig.java for allowed origins

## ü§ù Contributing

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
